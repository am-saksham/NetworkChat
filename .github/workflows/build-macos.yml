      # Note: We are baking in JVM options, but client.truststore needs to be INSIDE the app bundle or handled correctly.
      # Actually, since we use "TrustAll" in code now, the truststore args are less critical, but good to have if we revert.
      # HOWEVER, --input . includes client.truststore if it is in frontend dir.
      # Step 1940 shows client.truststore is in ROOT, not frontend/.
      # I should move truststore to frontend/ before jpackage?
      # Or just rely on the code-level TrustAll.
